Hint
You are given two integers n and k.

A positive integer x is called compatible if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

abs(n - x) <= k
(n & x) == 0
Return the sum of all compatible integers x.

Note:

Here, & denotes the bitwise AND operator.
The absolute difference between integers i and j is defined as abs(i - j).
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, k = 3

Output: 10

Explanation:

The compatible integers are:

x = 1, since abs(2 - 1) = 1 and 2 & 1 = 0.
x = 4, since abs(2 - 4) = 2 and 2 & 4 = 0.
x = 5, since abs(2 - 5) = 3 and 2 & 5 = 0.
Thus, the answer is 1 + 4 + 5 = 10.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, k = 1

Output: 0

Explanation:

There are no compatible integers in the range [4, 6]. Thus, the answer is 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= k <= 100
