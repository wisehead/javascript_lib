Hint
You are given a string s of length 10 consisting of digits.

The dial contains the digits 0 through 9 in order and is circular, so 0 and 9 are adjacent. The pointer initially points to 0.

To dial each digit of s in order, rotate the pointer until it points to that digit. Each rotation moves the pointer to an adjacent digit, and you may rotate in either direction. Dialing a digit that the pointer already points to requires no rotations.

Return the minimum total number of rotations needed to dial every digit of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "0192837465"

Output: 25

Explanation:

Step	From	To	Rotations
1	0	0	0
2	0	1	1
3	1	9	2
4	9	2	3
5	2	8	4
6	8	3	5
7	3	7	4
8	7	4	3
9	4	6	2
10	6	5	1
The total is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 25, which is the minimum total number of rotations.

Example 2:

Input: s = "1200210200"

Output: 12

Explanation:

Step	From	To	Rotations
1	0	1	1
2	1	2	1
3	2	0	2
4	0	0	0
5	0	2	2
6	2	1	1
7	1	0	1
8	0	2	2
9	2	0	2
10	0	0	0
The total is 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 12, which is the minimum total number of rotations.

 

Constraints:

s.length == 10
s consists only of digits '0' to '9'
